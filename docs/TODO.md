# Todos

* For `assertType<T>(v)`, it would be nice to have a stricter version that insists on `T` being the exact type of `v` (vs. `typeof v` being assignable to `T`).

## Potential future additions

* type-challenges has [several interesting utility types](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/utils/index.d.ts).
  * Looks useful: `Debug`
